Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 4.3 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build makes all category labels crisp like the transactions list:

- Replaced Chart.js text in Top Categories with pure HTML (Rent, Food, Shopping, etc.)
- Bars are styled divs so labels & values are sharp and clean
- Charts remain for Spendable vs Budget and Daily Budget Trend

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase4_3.html in a browser to see the sharper category labels.
