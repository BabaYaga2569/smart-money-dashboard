Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 4.2 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build refines the typography for a professional look:

- Numbers, chart labels, and transaction lists are crisp (no blur, no glow)
- Headers and highlights keep subtle neon glow for style
- Charts now render sharper with devicePixelRatio and clean fonts

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase4_2.html in a browser to see the sharper lettering.
