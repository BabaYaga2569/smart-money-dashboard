Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 4.1 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build activates live charts using Chart.js:

- Spendable vs Budget: line chart with neon glow colors
- Daily Budget Trend: animated bar chart
- Top Categories: horizontal bar chart replacing text list

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase4_1.html in a browser to see the new interactive charts.
3. Charts use mock data for now; can be wired to Plaid later.

Next step: style polish and wiring to real data feeds.
