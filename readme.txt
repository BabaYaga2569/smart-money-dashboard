Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 4.4 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build makes every label crisp like the transaction list:

- Removed blurry canvas labels from Spendable vs Budget and Daily Trend
- Added sharp HTML labels under each chart for days of week
- Top Categories already uses HTML rows for crisp labels and values
- All cockpit text is now consistent and professional

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase4_4.html in a browser to see fully crisp labels everywhere.
