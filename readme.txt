Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 3.1 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build adds:
- Bank account names (BofA, SoFi, USAA, Capital One) with mock balances
- Recurring Bills tile with total due + upcoming list
- Due-today bills highlighted in red glow

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase3_1.html in a browser to see the upgraded cockpit.
3. Still using mock data (not Plaid) for testing visuals.

Next step: reconnect Plaid and real recurring bills data once design is approved.
