Phase 6.4 - Firebase Cockpit with Currency Formatting + Navigation
--------------------------------------------------------------
Changes:
1. Currency formatting added: all saved/target amounts display as $X.XX (e.g. $100.00 / $500.00).
2. Sidebar navigation added to both index.html and goals.html, so you can switch between Dashboard and Savings Goals without closing the app.
3. Active page highlights green in the sidebar for clarity.

Setup:
1. Unzip into your GitHub repo.
2. Commit + push, Netlify redeploys automatically.
3. Test: 
   - /goals.html -> add goal, add contribution -> formatted as currency.
   - Sidebar links let you switch between Dashboard and Goals instantly.
