Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 3 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This is the Phase 3 visual demo of your Smart Money Dashboard.

Files included:
- index.html (new neon cockpit design with mock data)
- readme.txt (this file)

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index.html in a browser to see the new look.
3. This version uses mock data (not Plaid). Once design is locked, we can reconnect Plaid fetch calls.

Enjoy the glow!
