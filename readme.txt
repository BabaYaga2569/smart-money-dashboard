Smart Money Cockpit - Phase 4 Mockup
-----------------------------------

This build introduces a new Copilot-inspired layout with your unique features:

- Sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Transactions, Cash Flow, Accounts, Investments, Categories, Recurring Bills, Settings)
- Top row: charts placeholders (Spendable vs Budget, Daily Budget Trend)
- Mid row: Transactions To Review + Top Categories
- Bottom row: Monthly Income + Payday Countdown, Recurring Bills with total due and highlights

How to use:
1. Unzip into your project root (same place as your old index.html).
2. Open index_phase4.html in a browser to see the new dashboard layout.
3. Still using mock data for now.

Next step: add live Plaid data + interactive charts.
