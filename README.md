## Files

## How to Deploy
1. Download and unzip this package.
2. Copy the entire `netlify/functions/` folder into your GitHub repo (overwrite old files).
3. Commit and push to GitHub (or drag-and-drop to Netlify if uploading manually).
4. Netlify will redeploy automatically.
5. Test the site → balances and transactions should now work without 500 errors.
